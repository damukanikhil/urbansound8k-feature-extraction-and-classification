UrbanSound8K is a diverse and extensive dataset designed for urban sound classification tasks. It comprises a wide range of urban environmental audio recordings, containing 10 different classes of sounds, including sirens, street music, drilling, and more. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for researchers and machine learning enthusiasts interested in audio classification, environmental noise analysis, and urban sound research.

The project comprises two notebooks, each serving distinct purposes within the scope of the research. The first notebook focuses on feature extraction techniques, exploring various methods to extract meaningful features from the dataset. In contrast, the second notebook delves into machine learning and clustering algorithms, leveraging the extracted features for tasks such as classification and clustering. These notebooks collectively provide a comprehensive analysis of the dataset, incorporating both feature engineering and machine learning strategies to achieve meaningful insights and results.
